# OScrabbl
OScrabbl is a Scrabble game for the command-line interface developed using (mainly) functional constructs in OCaml. 

Final project submission for Cornell's CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures class, Spring 2020. (Yes, we somehow made this completely remotely during a pandemic.)

## How to play
As of right now, you can only run the test suite and individual functions via OCaml's [utop](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/about-utop/). We have included all the files needed to configure your utop correctly, so as long as you have OCaml and utop installed, you should be good to go.

- `make play`: Plays the game. Not ready as of yet, since the GUI is still under development.

## Functionality
- `make`: Runs OCaml's `utop` with the necessary build files.
- `make test`: Runs the test suite. Feel free to test other functions as necessary.
- `make clean`: Cleans the documentation from `make docs`, the zip file created using `make zip`, and/or the build files.
