(** [index c] is the 0-based index of [c] in the alphabet. 
    If [c] is the space character [' '] with ASCII code 32, return -33. *)
val index : char -> int

(** [index' n] is the reverse operation of [index c]. 
    [index' -33] is the space character [' ']. *)

(** [init_bag] is the starting bag associative array of letters to 
    their quantities. *)

(** [fill_hand st] fills the player's hand up to seven letters by 
    taking them out of the bag. *)

(** [put_on_bard (x,y) c st] sets the board of [st] with position [(x,y)] with 
    the letter corresponding to [c]. *)
val put_on_board : int * int -> char -> state -> state

(** [is_row lst b] returns whether [lst] contains coordinates that can be placed
    all in a single row or column, and whether the placement is valid for [b].
    Raises: [InvalidTilePlacement] if [lst] contains coordinates of multiple
    rows, columns, or both; also raised if [lst] does not form a connected 
    (aka valid) board state if inserted. *)

val set_history : string -> string -> int -> state -> state

(** [confirm_turn st] attempts to score the newly filled tiles by the 
    player, and on success, accumulates the points to the player's score. The 
    board is updated with the filled letters to be permanently set, and the
    coordinates of the filled tiles is reset. *)

(** [pass_turn st] is the new state with the current player's turn passed. *)
val pass_turn : state -> state

(** [init_state ()] is the initial state of every starting board.

(** [result] is either a [Valid] [state], or raises an [exn] if [Invalid]. *)
type result = Valid of state | Invalid of exn

(** [make_move (x,y) c st] attempts to make a placement on the board, checking 
    all the necessary constraints (bag, hand, board, etc.) to see if the move 
    is [Valid] or [Invalid]. *)
