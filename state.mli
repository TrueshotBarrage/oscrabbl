(** [fill_player_hand st] fills the player's hand up to seven letters by 
    taking them out of the bag. *)

(** [is_row lst b] returns whether [lst] contains coordinates that can be placed
    all in a single row or column, and whether the placement is valid for [b].
    Raises: [InvalidTilePlacement] if [lst] contains coordinates of multiple

    (aka valid) board state if inserted. *)

(** [confirm_player_turn st] attempts to score the newly filled tiles by the

    is [Valid] or [Invalid]. *)
